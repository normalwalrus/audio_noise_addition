# audio_noise_addition

This is to add noise and chatter_audio into audio files

All audio files must be in .wav format

Steps:

1. Ensure there is a chatter audio inside the 'chatter' folder
2. Put your audio to be noised into the 'audio' folder. Ensure your audio is in a folder, similar to the example folder in the 'audio' folder
3. Change the config.json file to your desired noise level and sampling rate
4. Run the main.py file ('Python3 main.py' from ROOT)
5. Find your noised audio in the respective 'chatter_audio' and 'noised_audio' folders
